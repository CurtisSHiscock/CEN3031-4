NOTE: The config.example.js file contains my database information. As of this update, i've run JSONToMongo from project 3 to fill it.
If the first two tests of listings.server.routes.js fail, then it's been emptied. You will need to run my JSONToMongo again with the uri in config.example.js.
Of course if all 5 tests fail, then something has gone wrong and I should begin panicking.
